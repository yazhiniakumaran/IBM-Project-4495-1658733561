Answer the questions or complete the tasks outlined in bold below, use the specific method described if applicable.

** What is 7 to the power of 4?**
"""

7**4

"""** Split this string:**

    s = "Hi there Sam!"
    
**into a list. **
"""

s = "Hi there Sam!"

print(s.split())

"""** Given the variables:**

    planet = "Earth"
    diameter = 12742

** Use .format() to print the following string: **

    The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.
"""

planet = "Earth"

"""** Given this nested list, use indexing to grab the word "hello" **"""

lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]

lst[3][1][2][0]

"""** Given this nest dictionary grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky **"""

d = {'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}

d['k1'][3]['tricky'][3]['target'][3]

"""** What is the main difference between a tuple and a list? **"""

#The list is dynamic, whereas the tuple has static characteristics. This means that lists can be modified whereas tuples cannot be modified, the tuple is faster than the list because of static in nature. Lists are denoted by the square brackets but tuples are denoted as parenthesis.

"""** Create a function that grabs the email website domain from a string in the form: **

    user@domain.com
    
**So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com**

"""** Create a function that counts the number of times the word "dog" occurs in a string. Again ignore edge cases. **"""
